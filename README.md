# portfolio
Personal portfolio for web, design, and various creative work.

This repository contains my personal portfolio-in-progress. It will be frequently updated as I move along and learn new things,
so stay tuned! It features examples of work both with development and art/design, a responsive design, a JavaScript-driven 
mobile drop-down menu, and a blog that includes a functional log-in and post-creating form (I'm excited about that part, as 
working with server-side code is still new to me). Feel free to look and poke around; I'm always eager for input, critique,
and suggestions!
